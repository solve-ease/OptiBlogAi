# Performance Optimization & Scaling Questions

## 📈 Performance Goals
**What performance improvements are you seeking?**
- [ ] Faster content generation
- [ ] Higher throughput (more requests/hour)
- [ ] Lower resource usage (CPU/Memory)
- [ ] Reduced API costs
- [ ] Better quality vs speed balance
- [ ] Improved caching strategies

## 🔢 Current Performance Metrics
**Share your current performance data:**
- **Content generation time:** [e.g., 30 seconds per article]
- **Throughput:** [e.g., 10 articles per hour]
- **Resource usage:** [CPU %, Memory usage]
- **API response times:** [average, p95, p99]
- **Error rates:** [percentage of failed requests]

## 🎯 Scale Requirements
**What scale are you targeting?**
- **Volume:** [articles per day/hour]
- **Concurrent users:** [expected simultaneous requests]
- **Data size:** [keywords processed, content generated]
- **Geographic distribution:** [single region vs global]

## 🏗️ Current Architecture
**Describe your current setup:**
- **Deployment:** [single server, cluster, serverless]
- **Database:** [type, size, optimization]
- **Caching:** [Redis, Memcached, CDN]
- **Load balancing:** [nginx, cloud LB, etc.]

## 🔍 Performance Bottlenecks
**Where are you seeing slowdowns?**
- [ ] Google Search API calls
- [ ] Web scraping/crawling
- [ ] Content extraction
- [ ] LLM API calls (Groq/Gemini)
- [ ] Content processing
- [ ] Database operations
- [ ] Network I/O
- [ ] Memory usage

## 💰 Cost Optimization
**API and infrastructure costs:**
- Current monthly spend on APIs
- Cost per generated article
- Infrastructure costs
- Target cost reduction goals

## ⚙️ Configuration Optimization
**Current OptiBlogAi configuration:**
```python
# Share relevant configuration parameters
BATCH_SIZE = 10
CRAWL_DELAY = 2.0
MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS = 5
# etc.
```
